\section{Methodology}

In this section, we describe the methodological framework proposed by \cite[Reid et al.]{reid2025linear}, which we aim to reproduce.
The core contribution is a technique to incorporate structural inductive biases (Topological Masking) into efficient Linear Transformers without breaking their $\mathcal{O}(N)$ complexity.

% In this section you should give a description of the methodological aspects of your work, for instance how you modified an existing method to perform a particular task or to overcome a particular limitation. If your project is about reproducibility, here you should describe the method presented in the original paper.
